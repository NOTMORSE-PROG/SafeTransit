## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js 20+** installed ([Download](https://nodejs.org/))
- **npm** package manager
- **Android Studio** with Android SDK installed
- **Physical Android device** with USB debugging enabled (recommended over emulator)
- **Google Maps API key** (free tier available - $200/month credit)

### Quick Start

1. **Clone and Install**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd SafeTransit
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure Environment**
   See [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) for detailed local setup instructions including:
   - Android SDK path configuration
   - Google Maps API key setup
   - Environment variables

3. **Build and Install (First Time)**
   ```bash
   npx expo run:android
   ```
   This builds and installs the development build on your device. You only need to do this once per device.

4. **Start Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   After the initial build, just use this command for daily development. Press `a` to open on Android, `r` to reload.

## 🗺️ Map Features

### Map Tips vs Forum Posts
- **Map Tips**: Location-specific alerts verified by admins, pinned to exact coordinates, categorized by type (lighting, harassment, transit, safe havens, construction)
- **Forum Posts**: Community discussions for broader safety topics with voting and threaded comments

### Interactive Elements
- **Tip Markers**: Color-coded by severity with intelligent visual hierarchy
  - 🔴 **High/Critical** - Red markers for dangerous situations requiring immediate attention
  - 🟡 **Medium** - Yellow markers for areas requiring caution
  - 🟢 **Low** - Green markers for minor concerns
- **Clustering**: Automatically groups nearby tips for better map readability
- **Heatmap**: Toggle-able safety zone overlay showing danger levels
- **Family Markers**: Real-time locations of connected family members
- **Filter Chips**: Filter tips by category, radius, and time relevance
- **Smooth Modals**: Auto-expanding tip details with proper backdrop dimming

## 🔐 Authentication & Security

- **JWT-based authentication** with secure token storage
- **Google Sign-In** integration (requires development build)
- **Email/Password** authentication
- **Token refresh** mechanism
- **Secure API communication** with bearer tokens
- **Background location permissions** with user consent

## 📊 Database Schema

The app uses PostgreSQL with Neon serverless driver. Key tables include:
- `users` - User accounts and profiles
- `tips` - Safety tips with location, category, status
- `forum_posts` - Community forum posts
- `forum_comments` - Threaded comments
- `family_members` - Family location sharing relationships
- `emergency_contacts` - User emergency contacts
- `notifications` - Push notification records

## 🚦 Route Planning & Safety Analysis

### Route Safety Algorithm
1. **Route Fetching**: Gets multiple route options from LocationIQ/OpenRouteService
2. **Bounding Box Calculation**: Determines area to search for safety tips
3. **Tip Aggregation**: Fetches all tips within route buffer (50m)
4. **Segment Analysis**: Divides route into ~100m segments
5. **Scoring**: Each segment scored based on nearby tip severity:
   - Harassment: 10 points (highest danger)
   - Poor Lighting: 5 points
   - Construction: 3 points
   - Transit Issues: 2 points
   - Safe Havens: -5 points (reduces danger)
6. **Color Coding**: Segments colored green/yellow/red based on safety score
7. **Overall Rating**: Calculates overall route safety score and danger zone count

### Route Display
- Color-coded polylines showing safe/dangerous segments
- Safety score (0-100) with rating (Safe, Caution, Unsafe)
- Danger zone count
- Tip summary by category
- Multiple route options with comparison

## 🔔 Background Protection

### How It Works
1. User enables "Background Protection" toggle
2. App requests "Always Allow" location permission
3. Background location tracking starts (even when app closed)
4. Location updates checked against danger zones
5. Alerts sent when entering high-risk areas
6. Battery-optimized tracking (~3-5% per hour)

### Requirements
- Android 11+ (SDK 30+)
- "Always Allow" location permission
- Background location permission granted
- Notification permissions enabled

## 🧪 Development Scripts

```bash
npm start              # Start Expo development server
npm run android        # Build and run on Android
npm run ios            # Build and run on iOS (if configured)
npm run web            # Start web version
npm run lint           # Run ESLint
npm run db:test        # Test database connection
npm run db:migrate     # Run database migrations
npm run db:reset       # Reset database (development only)
```

## 🐛 Common Issues & Troubleshooting

**Maps not showing?**
- Check `.env` file has `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`
- Verify API key is enabled at Google Cloud Console
- Rebuild: `npx expo run:android`

**SDK location error?**
- See [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) for Android SDK configuration
- Ensure `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable is set

**App crashes?**
- Run `npx expo run:android` at least once (uses dev client, not Expo Go)
- Check that all native dependencies are properly installed

**Build errors?**
- Try `npx expo start -c` to clear cache
- Ensure Android SDK is properly configured
- Check Node.js version (requires 20+)

**Changes not appearing?**
- Make sure Metro bundler is running (`npm start`)
- Press `r` in terminal to reload
- Or shake device → "Reload"
